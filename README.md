# Contributing

## Opening Statement

All contributions to the project are welcome, however should follow
reasonable community guidelines.

Ideally; contributions are made to independent branches, pulled into
development, then pulled into master.

Ideally; contributions consist of end-to-end tests, following exiting
examples (which will soon be improved).

Deployment will be an automated byproduct of such workflow in the near
future.

## Getting Started (Development)

The ISM is digested from src/ISM.json, which can be generated from the
partner project https://github.com/dmblack/ism-xml-to-ism-json

Refer to that project for usage, and simply copy the artefact to ./src/.
